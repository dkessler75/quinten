## Quinten's Injury Log

### Sprained Ankles

I was in fourth grade when my ankles started to sprain easily.  It all started when I was on a hill during elementary recess. I stepped into a hole and twisted my left ankle.  I knew it was injured because it started swelling.  I finished school and told my mom that my ankle was hurting.  She took a look at it and said that looks bad.  She got an ankle brace an had me wear it to school the next day.  Before school a kid in my class shoved me and I reinjured the same anckle.  I've had problems with my ankle ever since.

### Broken Wrist

I was playing outside and the dog was teathered in the backyard.  As I was standing the dog ran around me and tripped me with the leash.  I fell on my right arm and broke my wrist.  I was in a ton of pain and I ran inside and told my mom.  She took a look and told me to get in the van.  We rushed off to the doctor's office.  They pulled on my hand until my wrist popped back into place.  It actually felt pretty good.  I had to wear a brace for the rest of the summer.

### Sprained Knee

I was at a track meet in Huxley Iowa.  After the 800 I was slowing down and twisted my left knee.  I didn't realize I was hurt until I got home.  My knee was throbbing the next morning.  I went to school and had to limp through the halls.  Later that night my dad bought me a brace for my knee. After that day, since I couldn't walk my mom took me to the doctor with my annoying little sister.  The doctor took X-rays and decided that it was not a break or fracture. They gave me crutches and told me to use them until i could put weight on my leg. I went back to school the next day and everyone asked what i did to my knee, so i had to tell the same story over and over again.
